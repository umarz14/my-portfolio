                        Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate software developer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from 
                        California State University, Chico. I specialize in building reliable and efficient software solutions, 
                        focusing on web and mobile development, backend systems, and DevOps practices.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg"> 
                        Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects that showcase my passion for problem-solving and clean, maintainable code. I developed <strong>Coffee Realm</strong>, 
                        a full-stack web application using Angular and Bootstrap, with seamless Google Maps API integration to help users locate and rate coffee shops. Iâ€™ve also built applications 
                        like <strong>WorkoutPals</strong>, an Android app designed to connect gym-goers through real-time check-ins and messaging, and an <strong>Instagram Clone</strong>, 
                        demonstrating my ability to design and deliver feature-rich platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        In my free time, I enjoy working out, experimenting and learning through my homelab server, and hitting the slopes to snowboard. 
                    </p>
